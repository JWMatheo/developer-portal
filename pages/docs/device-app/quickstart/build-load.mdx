# Build & Load App

With the [Ledger Framework](./framework), you can build and load Embedded Apps on Linux, Mac and Windows, very easily, with the Visual Code Ledger extension.

## Introduction
 
The easiest way to develop your app is by using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), using: 
- the [ Ledger Developer Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools) in the Extensions Marketplace.
- a handy [Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) to put all your Apps in.  
   It can be useful to benefit from how existing apps have been coded.
- [Docker]( https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (not necessary for Linux), as well as
- An X11 server, such as [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) for Mac or VcXsrv (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) for Windows
for windows

## How it works 

The Extension does (nearly) everything. It:
- loads the Container in Docker, but you need Docker running beforehand, and it 
- has all the tasks to build, load and test your app, on the Ledger or in the emulaor
- as well as the tools to eveluate your tests, delete the build files, and other maintenance tasks.


## How-to 

1. Have Docker running (except for Linux because this is already a background task).
2. With Visual Studio Code, open the [Boilerplate App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate) or your own App.  
This opens the container in Docker
3. In XQuartz preferences, make sure connections from network client are allowed.
4. Use Ledger Developer Tools extension. When installed, it is in the Activity Bar. Click on it to open the tasks menu with `ctrl + shift + b` (`command + shift + b` on a Mac) to conveniently execute actions:
	- To pull and run the Docker image chose `Run dev-tools image`
	- To build your app chose `Build app`
	- To load it to a device, chose `Load app on device`

For more information, or if you want to manually Build and Load your app, read the [Boilerplate App documentation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate).

## Actions flow

The other actions are described in the [Boilerplate App repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate).

Here is the usual flow for using theses actions:
